This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Required for CCTP cross-chain transfers and permit-based payments
ADMIN_PKEY=0x... # Private key for the admin wallet that executes transactions
ADMIN_ADDRESS=0x... # Admin wallet address (must match the private key)

# Optional - RPC URLs (defaults provided)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ATTESTATION_API_URL=https://iris-api-sandbox.circle.com
```

**Security Note**: Never commit private keys to version control. Use environment variables or secure key management systems in production.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
